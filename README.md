## 🔧 Local Setup  

Follow these steps to run EcoLens locally:  

### 1️⃣ Frontend (Terminal 1)  
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


The frontend should now run on http://localhost:3000.

2️⃣ Backend with Ngrok (Terminal 2)
cd backend
ngrok http 5001


Copy the generated HTTPS URL (e.g., https://2593391a16e1.ngrok-free.app).

Open your .env file and paste it as your BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL.

3️⃣ Backend Server (Terminal 3)
cd backend
node server.js

4️⃣ Configure .env

Create a .env file inside the backend/ directory with the following variables:

PORT=5001
ML_BASE_URL=https://prishaa-library-space.hf.space

# Replace this with your ngrok URL
BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL=https://2593391a16e1.ngrok-free.app  

BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_key
CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY=your_cloudinary_secret
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SENDER_EMAIL=your_email
SENDER_PASSWORD=your_email_password
GOV_EMAIL=gov_email_if_any

✅ After this setup, your EcoLens app will be live locally with:

Frontend → http://localhost:3000

Backend (Ngrok) → https://xxxxxx.ngrok-free.app
